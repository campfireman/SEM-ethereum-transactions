This platform enables you to run decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts that have no central points of failure or control, integrate with a payment network, and operate on an open blockchain. With this practical guide, Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood provide everything you need to know about building smart contracts and DApps on Ethereum and other virtual-machine blockchains. Discover why IBM, Microsoft, NASDAQ, and hundreds of other organizations are experimenting with Ethereum. This essential guide shows you how to develop the skills necessary to be an innovator in this growing and exciting new industry},

  publisher = {{Courier Corporation}},
  abstract = {In this classic text, Dr. Davis provides a clear introduction to computability, at an advanced undergraduate level, that serves the needs of specialists and non-specialists alike.In Part One (Chapters 1\textendash{}5), Professor Davis outlines the general theory of computability, discussing such topics as computable functions, operations on computable functions, recursive functions, Turing machines, self-applied, and unsolvable decision problems. The author has been careful, especially in the first seven chapters, to assume no special mathematical training on the part of the reader.Part Two (Chapters 6\textendash{}8) comprises a concise treatment of applications of the general theory, incorporating material on combinatorial problems, Diophantine Equations (including Hilbert\&\#39;s Tenth Problem) and mathematical logic. The final three chapters (Part 3) present further development of the general theory, encompassing the Kleene hierarchy, computable functionals, and the classification of unsolvable decision problems.When first published in 1958, this work introduced much terminology that has since become standard in theoretical computer science. Indeed, the stature of the book is such that many computer scientists regard it as their theoretical introduction to the topic. This new Dover edition makes this pioneering, widely admired text available in an inexpensive format.For Dover\&\#39;s edition, Dr. Davis has provided a new Preface and an Appendix, \&quot;Hilbert\&\#39;s Tenth Problem Is Unsolvable,\&quot; an important article he published in The American Mathematical Monthly in 1973, which was awarded prizes by the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America. These additions further enhance the value and usefulness of an \&quot;unusually clear and stimulating exposition\&quot; (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris) now available for the first time in paperback.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10664-019-09796-5},
  abstract = {Ethereum is a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of code that perform general-purpose computations. For instance, smart contracts have been used to implement crowdfunding initiatives that raised a total of US\$6.2 billion from January to June of 2018. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study of smart contracts. Differently from prior studies that focused on particular aspects of a subset of smart contracts, our goal is to have a broader understanding of all contracts that are currently deployed in Ethereum. In particular, we elucidate how frequently used the contracts are (activity level), what they do (category), and how complex they are (source code complexity). To conduct this study, we mined and cross-linked data from four sources: Ethereum dataset on the Google BigQuery platform, Etherscan, State of the DApps, and CoinMarketCap. Our study period runs from July 2015 (inception of Ethereum) until September 2018. With regards to activity level, we notice that it is concentrated on a very small subset of the contracts. More specifically, only 0.05\% of the smart contracts are the target of 80\% of the transactions that are sent to contracts. New solutions to cope with Ethereum's limited scalability should take such an activity imbalance into consideration. With regards to categories, we highlight that the new and widely advertised rich programming model of smart contracts is currently being used to develop very simple applications that tend to be token-centric (e.g., ICOs, Crowdsales, etc). Finally, with regards to code complexity, we observe that the source code of high-activity verified contracts is small, with at most 211 instructions in 80\% of the cases. These contracts also commonly include at least two subcontracts and libraries in their source code. The comment ratio of these contracts is also significantly higher than that of GitHub top-starred projects written in Java, C++, and C\#. Hence, the source code of high-activity verified smart contracts exhibit particular complexity characteristics compared to other popular programming languages. Further studies are necessary to uncover the actual reasons behind such differences. Finally, based on our findings, we propose an open research agenda to drive and foster future studies in the area.},

This paper presents a set of data sampled every 15 seconds, from December 1st, 2018 to December 15, 2018, coming from different blockchain web APIs. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether and to what extent different variables - such as the number of pending transactions, the value of the USD/Ether pair, average electricity prices around the world, and the number of miners - influence the Ethereum transaction fees. This study is relevant from an economic perspective because more and more companies in different economic fields are adopting Ethereum blockchain. From historical data analysis, we found that only some of these variables do have an influence. For example, the number of pending transactions and the number of miners have a major influence on Ethereum transaction fees when compared to the other variables.},
